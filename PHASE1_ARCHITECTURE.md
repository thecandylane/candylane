# Candylane Phase 1 — Locked Architecture (v2)

> The keystone phase. `pull` and `revert` must be surgical: fresh Win11 VM → `pull` →
> the machine you wanted → `revert` → **functional-clean vanilla**, **10x in a row,
> zero breaks** ([ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) Phase 1). Everything here is decided.
> Implementation maps field-for-field and signature-for-signature to what follows.

**v2 changelog (three independent reviews — Claude subagent, Grok, +1 — converged on the
revert/recover path):** in-flight reconcile after crash; winget success sourced from
post-install probe, not exit code; rollback-during-rollback is bounded and best-effort;
winget undo is `best_effort` (not `inverse`) and "vanilla" is defined as functional-clean;
reboot-pending modeled; ownership verified before uninstall; `--resume` cut; `WingetExecutor`
seam for off-Windows tests; `windows-acl` carve-out for `candylane-crypto`; `foreign_keys=ON`
and a `meta` table from commit one.

## Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Crate layout | **3 crates**: `candylane-cli`, `candylane-core`, `candylane-crypto` (isolated) | Engineered enough. `windows-rs` deferred to Phase 3 **except** the crypto carve-out (#8). |
| 2 | Revert engine | **Inverse/best-effort op log primary**; VSS opt-in (`--restore-point`), never load-bearing | The per-action log powers `diff`/`history`/partial-revert and is air-gap-native (Phase 7). |
| 3 | Post-script reversibility | Paired up/down ⇒ `inverse`. No down-script ⇒ `one_way` (diff warns, revert skips+reports). **Certified `minimal-dev` profile: zero `one_way`.** | Honest reversibility; the test profile is invertible by construction. |
| 4 | Dotfiles | **Copy-manage**, one handler, no symlinks. `candylane add` → Phase 2. | No admin/Dev-Mode dependency; trivial revert (restore bytes). |
| 5 | Crash recovery | **Detect + explicit `candylane recover`**, rollback-to-clean only. **`--resume` cut from Phase 1** (same probe gap as a crash; safe default suffices). Recovery is re-entrant and reconciles the in-flight action first. | "No half-states." Nothing mutates the machine automatically. |
| 6 | Keystone test rig | **Hyper-V + `Checkpoint-VM`/`Restore-VMSnapshot`** | Native Windows-on-Windows. |
| 7 | "Vanilla" bar | **Functional-clean now, tighten later.** Revert asserts: `winget list` shows zero managed packages, `probe()` returns recorded before-state for every target, identifiable managed PATH entries removed. Registry/shell crumbs may remain and `diff`/`history` say so. Registry/PATH delta capture → **tracked Phase 3 TODO** (rides the debloat engine's registry machinery). | winget cannot restore registry/PATH/shortcuts. This bar asserts only what winget can prove, so the 10x loop asserts something true. |
| 8 | `windows-rs` carve-out | **One Windows-API dependency allowed in `candylane-crypto` only** (`windows-acl` or a thin `windows` slice) to set+assert owner-only ACLs. Deferral holds everywhere else (registry/services/DISM). | CRITICAL #3 is unimplementable with `std` on Windows; the deferral was about not doing system surgery early, not about gutting the trust model. The crate boundary contains the exception. |

Obvious calls locked: **delta ownership** (revert only undoes what Candylane installed),
**back up bytes not just hashes**, **single-writer lockfile** (`fs2`, fail-fast, PID
stale-check), **diff is honest** about `best_effort`/`one_way` residue.

## The model

Compute a plan, execute action-by-action, record an undo recipe per action. Revert replays
the recipes in reverse. Success is read from the system, never assumed from an exit code.

```
PROFILE (TOML) ──parse──▶ DESIRED ┐
                                  ├─diff─▶ PLAN (ordered Actions)
SYSTEM ────────probe────▶ ACTUAL ─┘            │
                                               ▼
                       pull = execute Plan, per Action:
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 1. write intent (status=pending)        ◀── crash-safe point   │
   │ 2. capture before (exists? version? bytes?)                    │
   │ 3. handler.apply()  (winget | copy | run script)              │
   │ 4. handler.probe() AGAIN → confirm real effect (not exit code) │
   │ 5. write after + undo recipe (status=applied)                 │
   │ on Err → status=failed → STOP → rollback this op (seq DESC)    │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

revert  = actions WHERE op=last AND status=applied, undo in REVERSE seq
recover = pending op detected → RECONCILE in-flight action (probe vs before,
          synthesize an applied/skipped record) → rollback-to-clean. Re-entrant.
```

## Crate layout

```
candylane-cli      clap parsing, human output, spinners (indicatif)        [bin]
candylane-core     state engine, Handler trait, WingetExecutor seam,       [lib]
                   3 handlers, diff, profile module
candylane-crypto   Ed25519 keygen/sign/verify, key storage,                [lib, isolated]
                   owner-only ACL set+assert (windows-acl carve-out)
```

## State schema (SQLite at `~/.candylane/state.db`, WAL, `foreign_keys=ON`, atomic writes)

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;          -- SQLite does NOT enforce FKs without this. Set every connection.

### Per-handler `before_json` / `undo_json` shapes

```
winget   before {"installed":bool,"version":"x.y.z"|null,"scope":"user|machine"|null}
         undo   {"op":"uninstall","pkg":"Git.Git","version":"x.y.z",   # best_effort
                 "path_entries":["C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd"]}        # cleaned on revert if present
                {"op":"noop","reason":"pre-existing"}                   # noop (delta ownership)
         NOTE: undo_kind=best_effort. Revert runs uninstall + removes the managed PATH
               entries we recorded. Registry/shell crumbs may remain (see Decision #7).
               winget invoked with --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
               --silent (non-interactive; a fresh VM hangs without these).

dotfile  before {"existed":bool,"sha256":"..."|null,"backup":"~/.candylane/backups/<op>/<seq>.bin"|null}
         undo   {"op":"remove","path":"..."}                           # inverse (target was absent)
                {"op":"restore","path":"...","backup":"...","sha256":"..."}  # inverse (target existed)

script   before {}
         undo   {"op":"run","script":"./down.ps1","timeout_s":120}     # inverse (paired)
                {"op":"none","note":"one_way; effects not reverted"}    # one_way
```

## The `Handler` trait + `WingetExecutor` seam

```rust
/// A unit of work the engine can plan, execute, record, and reverse.
/// Implemented by WingetHandler, DotfileHandler, ScriptHandler.
pub trait Handler {
    fn kind(&self) -> HandlerKind;

    /// Pure read of current system state for `target`. Used by diff, recovery,
    /// AND post-apply confirmation. Never mutates.
    fn probe(&self, target: &Target) -> Result<Probe>;

    /// Given desired item + probed state, decide what to do.
    /// Ok(None) when already satisfied (idempotency / re-pull no-op).
    fn plan(&self, desired: &Item, probe: &Probe) -> Result<Option<PlannedAction>>;

    /// Execute a planned action, then RE-PROBE to confirm the real effect.
    /// Success is defined by probe state, not by subprocess exit code.
    /// The engine has already written status=pending BEFORE this is called.
    fn apply(&self, action: &PlannedAction, ctx: &ApplyCtx) -> Result<Applied>;

    /// Reverse a previously-applied action from its recorded recipe.
    /// MUST be idempotent. For best_effort actions, verify ownership before
    /// destroying state (don't uninstall a package the user manually upgraded).
    fn undo(&self, action: &RecordedAction, ctx: &ApplyCtx) -> Result<()>;
}

/// Subprocess seam so winget logic is unit-testable off-Windows (Finding #12).
/// Real impl shells `winget.exe`; tests inject a fake.
pub trait WingetExecutor: Send + Sync {
    fn install(&self, pkg: &str) -> Result<RawOutput>;   // adds --accept-* --silent
    fn uninstall(&self, pkg: &str) -> Result<RawOutput>;
    fn list(&self, pkg: &str) -> Result<RawOutput>;      // probe source of truth
}

pub enum HandlerKind   { Winget, Dotfile, Script }
pub enum UndoKind      { Inverse, BestEffort, OneWay, Noop }   // v2: BestEffort

}
```

### Engine loop (in terms of the trait)

```
pull(profile):
  preflight: winget present? reboot-pending? (abort early if pending)   # v2 (#6)
  op = db.begin(kind=pull, status=pending)
  for (seq, desired) in profile.items().enumerate():
      probe = handler.probe(desired.target)?
      match handler.plan(desired, probe)?:
          None      => db.insert(action, seq, status=skipped)           # idempotent
          Some(pa)  =>
              db.insert(action, seq, status=pending, before=pa.before, undo_kind=pa.undo_kind)
              match handler.apply(pa, ctx):          # apply RE-PROBES; success = real state
                  Ok(applied) =>
                      reboot_pending_check()?         # v2: a package may have set it (#5)
                      db.update(seq, status=applied, after, undo_json=applied.undo)
                  Err(e)      => db.update(seq, status=failed, error=e)
                                 rollback(op); finalize_op(op); return Err(e)
  db.update(op, status=applied)

rollback(op):                  # body of revert() and recover()
  for action in db.actions(op, status=applied) ORDER BY seq DESC:
      loop up to ctx.max_undo_attempts:
          match handler.undo(action, ctx):
              Ok(())  => db.update(action, status=reverted); break
              Err(e)  => db.bump(action.undo_attempts); db.set(action.undo_error=e)
      if still failing: db.update(action, status=undo_failed)   # v2: best-effort CONTINUE,
                                                                  # do NOT abort the whole rollback
  # never loops forever; reports every undo_failed at the end

finalize_op(op):                                                  # v2
  if any action undo_failed → op.status = revert_failed
  elif any action still applied → op.status = partially_reverted
  else → op.status = reverted

recover():                     # on detecting a pending op at startup
  reconcile(pending_op)        # v2 (#1): the big one
  rollback(pending_op)
  finalize_op(pending_op)

reconcile(op):                 # v2 (#1) — the in-flight action's real outcome is UNKNOWN
  a = pending action of op (status=pending), if any
  real = handler.probe(a.target)
  if real != a.before:         # apply actually changed the system before the crash
      synthesize a.after + a.undo_json from `real`; a.status = applied
  else:                        # apply never took effect
      a.status = skipped
  # now rollback() will correctly undo (or skip) it — no stranded packages
```

## The CRITICALs (silent-failure class — designed in, not discovered)

1. **Script timeout** — `ApplyCtx.timeout` enforced in `ScriptHandler::apply`; on elapse kill → `Err` → fail → rollback.
2. **Restore integrity gate** — `DotfileHandler::undo` (`op=restore`) hashes the backup and compares to `undo_json.sha256` **before** writing. Mismatch → refuse + loud error.
3. **Key perms** — `candylane-crypto::Identity::{generate,load}` sets and **asserts on every load** an owner-only ACL via the `windows-acl` carve-out (Decision #8). Not best-effort.
4. **Crash reconcile** (v2) — `recover` reconciles the in-flight action before rollback, so a power-loss mid-install can never strand an untracked package.
5. **Bounded rollback** (v2) — a failing `undo` is retried up to `max_undo_attempts`, then marked `undo_failed`; rollback continues best-effort and reports. No infinite recovery loop.

## Phase 1 minimal profile (`candylane/minimal-dev`)

```toml
name    = "minimal-dev"
version = "0.1"

[packages.winget]
install = ["Git.Git", "Microsoft.VisualStudioCode", "BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC"]

[dotfiles]
[[dotfiles.file]]
src    = "./home/.gitconfig"
target = "$HOME/.gitconfig"

[[post_install]]
run  = "./scripts/example-tweak.ps1"
undo = "./scripts/example-tweak.undo.ps1"   # REQUIRED (certified profile: zero one_way)
```

## Test spec (write alongside each handler — ~32 unit + 5 E2E)

## Failure modes

| Codepath | Realistic failure | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| winget apply | exit 0 but not installed (scope fallback / deferred installer) | re-probe after apply; fail on `installed=false` (v2) |
| winget apply | source agreement prompt on fresh VM | `--accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --silent` (v2) |
| winget install | sets reboot-pending → next install aborts | preflight + post-install reboot-pending check (v2) |
| winget undo | user manually upgraded the package | verify owned version before uninstall (v2) |
| dotfile undo | backup bytes missing/corrupt | sha256 gate refuses to write (CRITICAL #2) |
| dotfile undo | target locked by running app (Windows mandatory lock) | distinct error → "close X before reverting" (v2) |
| script apply | post-script hangs forever | timeout kills it (CRITICAL #1) |
| crypto | private key readable by others | owner-only ACL + assert-on-load via `windows-acl` (CRITICAL #3) |
| rollback | an `undo` permanently fails (Defender lock) | bounded retries → `undo_failed` → continue → report (CRITICAL #5) |
| recover | in-flight action's real state unknown | reconcile (probe vs before) before rollback (CRITICAL #4) |
| engine write | disk full mid-write → DB corruption | `rust-atomicwrites` + WAL |

## NOT in scope (Phase 1)

Profile signing/verification (Phase 5), vault/secrets, `extends`/inheritance, lockfile (the
TOML one), debloat engine (Phase 3), WSL (Phase 4), multi-profile, `candylane add` (Phase 2),
`windows-rs` outside the crypto carve-out (Phase 3), **`--resume` (cut)**, and
**registry/PATH delta capture** — deferred to Phase 3, ride the debloat engine's registry
machinery (TRACKED, not forgotten). Phase 1 = one local profile, one local identity, the 10x
functional-clean loop.

## What we reuse (don't reinvent)

`twpayne/chezmoi` (copy-manage + diff/apply), `SubconsciousCompute/privacy-sexy-rs`
(reversible-action pattern in Rust), `hashicorp/terraform` (plan = diff), `rusqlite`,
`untitaker/rust-atomicwrites`, `fs2` (lockfile), `clap`, `console-rs/indicatif`,
`windows-acl` (crypto carve-out). See [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md).
